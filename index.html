      <p class="about-desc">&emsp; &emsp; Mahendra Singh Dhoni (born 7 July 1981), is an Indian international cricketer
        who captained the Indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2016 and in Test cricket from 2008
        to 2014. He is the only captain in the history of Cricket to win all ICC trophies. Under his captaincy, India
        won the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and the 2013 ICC
        Champions Trophy. A right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, Dhoni is one of the highest run scorers
        in One Day Internationals (ODIs) with more than 10,000 runs scored and is considered an effective "finisher" in
        limited-overs formats. He is also regarded by some as one of the best wicket-keepers and captains in modern
        limited-overs international cricket.</p>

      <p class="details1-desc">&emsp; &emsp; Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand), and he identifies as a
        Hindu Rajput. His paternal village Lwali is in the Lamgara block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand. Dhoni's
        parents moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi, where his father Pan Singh worked in junior management positions in
        MECON. Dhoni has a sister Jayanti Gupta and a brother Narendra Singh Dhoni. Dhoni is a fan of Adam Gilchrist,
        and his childhood idols were cricket teammate Sachin Tendulkar, Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan and singer Lata
        Mangeshkar.</p>
      <p class="details1-desc1">&emsp; &emsp;Dhoni also holds numerous captaincy records such as the most wins by an
        Indian captain in ODIs and T20Is, and most back-to-back wins by an Indian captain in ODIs. He took over the ODI
        captaincy from Rahul Dravid in 2007 and led the team to its first-ever bilateral ODI series wins in Sri Lanka
        and New Zealand. In June 2013, when India defeated England in the final of the Champions Trophy in England,
        Dhoni became the first captain to win all three ICC limited-overs trophies (World Cup, Champions Trophy and the
        World Twenty20). After taking up the Test captaincy in 2008, he led the team to series wins in New Zealand and
        the West Indies, and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 2008, 2010 and 2013. In 2009, Dhoni also led the Indian team
        to number one position for the first time in the ICC Test rankings.</p>
